# (2) Spike ins + i5
# (3) Spike ins + i7
# (4) Spike ins + i5+i7

# How many nucleotides are the found barcodes allowed to differ from the original barcodes?
0

# If using spike-ins: how many nucleotides are the found spike-in sequences allowed to differ from
# the original sequences? Enter a 0 if you are not using spike-in sequences
0

# Which sequencer has been used?
# (1) iSeq / MiniSeq / NextSeq / HiSeq3000 / HiSeq4000
# (2) MiSeq / HiSeq2000-2500 / Novaseq

# In which folder would you like to save the output file?
output\

# What name would you like to use for the output file?
comb_spike

# What is the maximum percentage of contamination compared to the amount of correct reads? Please use the following format:
# Write '1' for 1% max contamination
# Write '0.1' (seperated by a dot) for 0.1% max contamination
0.1

# If using spike-ins: what are the i5 and i7 ends of the spike-in sequences?
# (1) i5 - spike-in sequence - i7
# (2) i7 - spike-in sequence - i5

# If using spike-ins: how many nucleotides should be trimmed from the i5 end?
0

# If using spike-ins: how many nucleotides should be trimmed from the i7 end?
0

# If using spike ins: In which order would you like for the program to count the sequences?
# (1) Per column: A1=1, B1=2, C1=3, ..., A2=9, B2=10, C2=11, ...
# (2) Per row: A1=1, A2=2, A3=3, ..., B1=13, B2=14, B2=15, ...
